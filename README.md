## Customization

This toolkit has it's own default set of colors.

``` text
red => Alerts or critical points
yellow => warnings or significant changes
green => successfull result or helpful text
blue => default prompt color
```

Also there is an option to provide default values to options.

Please edit `UserConfig.py` file to change color settings or option settings.

The config also provides a `powershell` and a `nonpowershell` theme (use the powershell theme if using `windows powershell`, not required in windows 11).
